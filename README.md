To build the Android App, first open the application in Eclipse with the latest Android SDK and Facebook Android SDK. You will need to set the **serverURL** variable in the **MainActivity.java** as the as local-ip of the rails app running on your computer. Make sure that both Android app and Rails app are running on the same network to be able to connect to the server through a common router. Then build the app using Eclipse.
